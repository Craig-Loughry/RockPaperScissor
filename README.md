1)"VW" on text was used as it would adjust size based on viewport width, or screen size. When the window size changes, the text changes with it. 
2)Text-Align: Center is used multiple times to keep text centered in their respective container.
3)justify-content: center - Aligns flex items along the main axis of the current line of the flex container.
